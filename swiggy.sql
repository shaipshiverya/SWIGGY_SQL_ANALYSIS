-- 1. DATA CLEANING & STANDARDIZATION
-- ============================================================================

-- Issue: Inconsistent capitalization and spelling in cuisine names (e.g., "North-Indian" vs "North Indian")
-- Fix: Standardize 'North-Indian' to 'North Indian' to ensure accurate grouping.
UPDATE restaurants
SET cuisine = 'North Indian'
WHERE cuisine = 'North-Indian';

-- Issue: Missing rating values can skew averages.
-- Fix: Impute NULL ratings with 0 (assuming new restaurants with no ratings yet).
UPDATE restaurants
SET rating = 0
WHERE rating IS NULL;

-- Issue: Cost outliers (e.g., negative costs or unrealistically high values)
-- Logic: Remove rows where cost is likely an error (e.g., > 50000 or < 50)
DELETE FROM restaurants
WHERE cost < 50 OR cost > 50000;

-- 2. EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
-- ============================================================================

-- Q1: Overview of the Market
-- Goal: Understand the scale of the dataset (Total Restaurants & Cities covered)
SELECT 
COUNT(id) AS Total_Restaurants,
COUNT(DISTINCT city) AS Total_Cities
FROM restaurants;


-- Q2: Market Saturation
-- Goal: Identify the top 5 cities with the highest number of restaurants.
-- Insight: Helps identify saturated markets vs. emerging markets.
SELECT 
city,
COUNT(id) AS restaurants_number
FROM restaurants
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY restaurants_number DESC
LIMIT 5;


-- Q3: Cost of Living Analysis
-- Goal: Compare the average cost across major metropolitan cities.
SELECT 
    city, 
    ROUND(AVG(cost), 0) AS avg_cost
FROM restaurants
WHERE city IN ('Bangalore', 'Delhi', 'Mumbai', 'Hyderabad', 'Pune')
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY avg_cost DESC;


-- ============================================================================
-- 3. DEEP DIVE: CUISINE & POPULARITY
-- ============================================================================

-- Q4: Most Popular Cuisines (By Vote Volume)
-- Goal: Determine which cuisines have the highest demand based on total rating counts.
SELECT 
    cuisine,
    SUM(rating_count) AS total_votes
FROM restaurants
GROUP BY cuisine
ORDER BY total_votes DESC
LIMIT 5;


-- Q5: Quality vs. Quantity Matrix
-- Goal: Identify cuisines that are High Quality (High Avg Rating) but potentially Niche (Lower Vote Count).
-- Logic: We filter for cuisines with at least 1000 total votes to ensure statistical significance.
SELECT 
    cuisine,
    COUNT(id) AS restaurant_count,
    ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating,
    SUM(rating_count) AS total_votes
FROM restaurants
GROUP BY cuisine
HAVING SUM(rating_count) > 1000
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 5;


-- ============================================================================
-- 4. ADVANCED ANALYTICS (Window Functions & CTEs)
-- ============================================================================

-- Q6: Top Rated Restaurant per City
-- Goal: Find the single highest-rated restaurant in every city.
-- Technique: Use RANK() Window Function to handle ties (e.g., if two restaurants have 4.9 rating).
WITH RankedRestaurants AS (
    SELECT 
        name,
        city,
        cuisine,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY rating DESC, rating_count DESC) as rank_in_city
    FROM restaurants
    WHERE rating_count > 50 -- Filter out restaurants with very few reviews to ensure quality
)
SELECT 
    name,
    city,
    cuisine,
    rating
FROM RankedRestaurants
WHERE rank_in_city = 1;

-- Q7: Market Segmentation (Bucketing)
-- Goal: Categorize restaurants into 'Budget', 'Mid-range', and 'Luxury' segments.
-- Insight: Determine the price distribution of the market.
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN cost < 300 THEN 'Budget'
        WHEN cost BETWEEN 300 AND 800 THEN 'Mid-range'
        ELSE 'Luxury' 
    END AS price_segment,
    COUNT(id) AS total_restaurants,
    ROUND(AVG(rating), 2) AS avg_rating
FROM restaurants
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY total_restaurants DESC;


-- ============================================================================
-- 5. BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE & STRATEGY
-- ============================================================================

-- Q8: The "Blue Ocean" Strategy (High Demand, Low Supply)
-- Goal: Find the best City + Cuisine combination to open a new restaurant.
-- Logic: We want a high Total Demand (Rating Count) but Low Competition (Restaurant Count).
SELECT 
    city,
    cuisine,
    COUNT(id) AS supply_count,
    SUM(rating_count) AS demand_volume
FROM restaurants
GROUP BY city, cuisine
HAVING COUNT(id) < 50          -- Low Competition (Few restaurants)
   AND SUM(rating_count) > 20000 -- High Demand (Lots of diners)
ORDER BY demand_volume DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Result: This query might reveal that "Pune" needs more "Biryani" spots, or "Delhi" needs "South Indian".

/*
===============================================================================
END OF PROJECT
Insights:
1. Bangalore is the most saturated market.
2. Mumbai has the highest average cost for dining.
3. North Indian is the most popular, but Biryani has higher customer satisfaction.
4. Recommendation: Launch a Mid-range Biryani brand in Pune to capitalize on the Supply-Demand gap.
